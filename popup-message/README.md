# Popup Message :speech_balloon:

This plugin displays a message, in a popup, to a user when they enter a space.

## Usage :clipboard:

- **Step 1:** Host the plugin on a [CORS enabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) server, or upload the entire `popup-message` directory into your own space
  - If you are hosting the plugin on a server, you need to copy the full URL to the `index.js` file
  - To host the plugin in your own space, you can go to File -> Storage and click the top-right "upload" button
  - Once it has been uploaded, click on the `index.js` file and select "Copy URL"
- **Step 2:** Add the plugin to your space by clicking "Plugins" and scrolling to the bottom to click the "Add from URL" button. Paste the URL to the plugin here.
- **Step 3:** In the plugins list, find the "Popup Message" plugin and click the "Settings" button next to it. Make sure to check the "Enabled" checkbox to show the popup when users arrive in the space.
- **Done!** Now you should see the popup when entering the space.
