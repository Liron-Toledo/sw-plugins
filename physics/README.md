# Physics :rocket:

This plugin allows objects in the space to have physics, so they can be moved around by,
and collide with, users.

## Usage :clipboard:

- **Step 1:** Host the plugin on a [CORS enabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) server, or upload the entire `physics` directory into your own space
  - If you are hosting the plugin on a server, you need to copy the full URL to the `index.js` file
  - To host the plugin in your own space, you can go to File -> Storage and click the top-right "upload" button
  - Once it has been uploaded, click on the `index.js` file and select "Copy URL"
- **Step 2:** Add the plugin to your space by clicking "Plugins" and scrolling to the bottom to click the "Add from URL" button. Paste the URL to the plugin here.
- **Step 3:** Right click on the object you would like to apply physics to and select "Properties", then click "Components" and click "Add Component". Click on the "Physics" component.
- **Step 4:** You can change various options to match the object you are applying the physics to.
- **Done!** Now you should be able to move the object around and interact with it.
