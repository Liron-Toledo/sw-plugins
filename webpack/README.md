# Webpack Showcase

It is possible to use external libraries in SpatialWeb plugins by bundling it
with Webpack. Here is an example of a Webpack configuration.

To build the plugin, run the following commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the plugin
npm run build
```

You can now add the plugin found at `dist/WebpackShowcase.min.js` into your space.
